GoPass is a super simple CLI program for generating "random" passwords.

## Usage

> **Note** This project is just **me** learning Golang, the code is not perfect ðŸ˜….

After you've cloned the repo, you first need to define the options in the `main.go` file

```go
option := internal.Option{
  Length: 16,
  HasUppercase: true,
  HasLowercase: true,
  HasNumber: true,
  HasSymbol: true
}

pwd, score := internal.Generate(option)
```

And now, you can run the program with `go run .` or build it `go build` to generate passwords.
